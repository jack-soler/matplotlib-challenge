In this challenge we used matplotlib to create series of graphs and charts to show mouse tumors upon different timepoints

This allowed us to see which drugs were the most and least effective

We were also able to analyze the specific drug Capomulin more closely

This helped us improving our skills using matplotlib and the scipy extentions
